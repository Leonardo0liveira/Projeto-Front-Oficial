      <h6>Finite-group gauge theories on lattices as Hamiltonian systems with constraints</h6>

      <h6>Modern Physics Letters A - Vol. 38, No. 06, 2330001 (2023) - <a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/S021773232330001X">https://doi.org/10.1142/S021773232330001X</a></h6>
      <br>
      <p>Abstract: In this work, we present a brief but insightful overview of the gauge theories, which are defined on n-dimensional lattices by using finite gauge groups, in order to show how they can be interpreted as a Hamiltonian system with constraints, analogous to what happens with the classical (continuous) gauge (field) theories. As this interpretation is not usually explored in the literature that discusses/introduces the concept of lattice gauge theory, but some recent works have been exploring Hamiltonian models in order to support some kind of quantum computation, we use this interpretation to, for example, present a brief geometric view of one class of these models: the Kitaev Quantum Double Models.</p>

      <h6>Quantum Double Models coupled to matter fields: a detailed review for a dualization procedure</h6>
      <br>
      <h6>International Journal of Quantum Information - Vol. 21, No. 04, 2350018 (2023) - <a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219749923500181">https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219749923500181</a></h6>
      <br>
      <p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how it is possible to define a new class of lattice gauge models based on a dualization procedure of a previous generalization of the Kitaev Quantum Double Models. In the case of this previous generalization that will be used as a basis, it was defined by adding new qudits (which were denoted as matter fields in reference to some works) to the lattice vertices with the intention of, for instance, interpreting its models as Kitaev Quantum Double Models coupled with Potts ones. Now, with regard to the generalization that we investigate here, which we want to define as the dual of this previous one, these new qudits were added to the lattice faces. And as the coupling between gauge and matter qudits of the previous generalization was performed by a gauge group action, we show that the dual behavior of these two generalizations was achieved by coupling these same qudits in the second one through a gauge group co-action homomorphism. One of the most striking dual aspects of these two generalizations is that, in both, part of the quasiparticles that were inherited from the Kitaev Quantum Double Models become confined when these action and co-action are nontrivial. But the big news here is that, in addition to the group homomorphism (that defines this gauge group co-action) allows us to classify all the different models of this second generalization, this same group homomorphism also suggests that all these models can be interpreted as two-dimensional restrictions of the 2-lattice gauge theories.</p>

      <h6>Non-Abelian fusion rules from Abelian systems with SPT phases and graph topological order</h6>
      <br>
      <h6>Annals of Physics - Volume 446, 169109 (2022) - <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aop.2022.169109"> https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aop.2022.169109</a></h6>
      <br>
      <p>Abstract: Since Padmanabhan and Teotonio-Sobrinho (2015) show the emergence of non-Abelian fusion rules in some examples of a class of Abelian models, but does not prove whether these rules also exist in other cases, the purpose of this paper is to present such proof emphasizing the importance of the existence of these rules. By the way, as the ground state of these models can be degenerated as a function of their algebra and, hence, they can support some symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, we prove that these non-Abelian fusion rules are always necessary for these SPT phase transitions to occur via a condensation mechanism or/and some global symmetry breaking.

      <h6>Classification of the Ground State Space for Abelian Higher Gauge Symmetry Models</h6>
      <br>
      <h6>arXiv:2207.09522 [math-ph] - <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.09522"> https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.09522</a></h6>
      <br>
      <p>Abstract: In the literature, abelian higher gauge symmetry models are shown to be valid in all finite dimensions and exhibit the characteristic behavior of SPT phases models. While the ground state degeneracy and the entanglement entropy were thoroughly studied, the classification of the ground state space still remained obscure. Anticipating the notation of the current paper, if (C∙,∂C∙) is the chain complex associated to the geometrical content of these models, while (G∙,∂G∙) is its symmetries counterpart, we show that the ground state space is classified by a H0(C,G)×H0(C,G) group, where H0(C,G) is the 0-th cohomology group associated to its structure and H0(C,G) is the corresponding 0-th homology group.
